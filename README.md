# What is it?
Small library to validate your precious data (in three different flavours). Create validator, extract the desired scheme and customize it in simple imperative style. Want to reset your scheme settings? Too bad, that's impossible. Create a new one I guess.
## How to actually use it?
Look inside 'app/src/test', answers are there.
